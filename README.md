# STDENT-ADMISSION-PREDICTION-
It describes a statistical machine learning system developed to support the work of the graduate admissions at various Educational Institutes providing graduate courses. The project is basically to explore what kind of data is provided, determine the most important factors that contribute to a student's chance of admission, and select the most accurate model to predict the probability of admission.
The dataset has GRE, GPA and university Rank. From these data we have to identify that if a student will get an admit (0 or 1) in that university or not. So, this is a classification problem.
